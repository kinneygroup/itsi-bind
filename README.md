### Services
ISC-Bind monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of DNS performance:

1. BIND
    * Description: BIND DNS server, representing server and service health.
2. DNS_Service
    * Description: The primary DNS service responsible for handling all DNS-related operations.
3. Bind_Server_Health
    * Description: The server running the BIND software, which is the backbone of the DNS service.
4. DNS_Queries
    * Description: Handles the processing of incoming DNS queries.
5. DNS_Responses
    * Description: Manages the responses sent back to DNS queries.
6. DNS_Cache
    * Description: Manages the DNS cache to improve query response times.
7. DNS_Zone_Transfer
    * Description: Manages the transfer of DNS zone data between servers.
8. DNS_Security
    * Description: Handles security-related aspects of the DNS service, including DNSSEC.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. CPU Pct
    * Description: The percentage of CPU being used by the Bind server.
2. Memory Pct
    * Description: The percentage of memory being used by the Bind server.
3. Uptime
    * Description: The amount of time the Bind server has been running.
4. Disk IO
    * Description: The rate of disk input/output operations.
5. Network IO
    * Description: The rate of network input/output operations.
6. Query Rate
    * Description: The rate at which DNS queries are being processed.
7. Query Errors
    * Description: The number of errors encountered while processing DNS queries.
8. Recursive Rate
    * Description: The rate at which recursive DNS queries are being processed.
9. Recursive Errors
    * Description: The number of errors encountered while processing recursive DNS queries.
10. Response Rate
    * Description: The rate at which DNS responses are being sent.
11. Response Errors
    * Description: The number of errors encountered while sending DNS responses.
12. Latency
    * Description: The time taken to respond to DNS queries.
13. NXDOMAIN Rate
    * Description: The rate of NXDOMAIN responses.
14. Cache Hit Rate
    * Description: The rate at which DNS queries are being served from the cache.
15. Cache Miss Rate
    * Description: The rate at which DNS queries are not found in the cache and need to be resolved.
16. Cache Size
    * Description: The size of the DNS cache.
17. Zone Transfer Rate
    * Description: The rate of DNS zone transfers.
18. Zone Transfer Errors
    * Description: The number of errors encountered during DNS zone transfers.
19. Zone Transfer Success
    * Description: The success rate of DNS zone transfers.
20. DNSSEC Failures
    * Description: The number of DNSSEC validation failures.
21. Unauthorized Access
    * Description: The number of unauthorized access attempts.
22. DDoS Events
    * Description: The number of DDoS attack events detected.
23. Security Events
    * Description: The number of security-related events.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, DNS_Service is dependent on the Bind_Server and other services like DNS_Queries, DNS_Responses, DNS_Cache, DNS_Zone_Transfer, and DNS_Security. Similarly, DNS_Responses relies on DNS_Queries for generating responses.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as DNS_Queries depending on Bind_Server, illustrating a layered approach to DNS monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
